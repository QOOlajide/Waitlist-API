# FastAPI on Vercel

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance, web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints. You can deploy a FastAPI app to Vercel with zero configuration.

## [Get started with FastAPI on Vercel](#get-started-with-fastapi-on-vercel)

You can quickly deploy a FastAPI application to Vercel by creating a FastAPI app or using an existing one:

[![](https://api-frameworks.vercel.sh/framework-logos/fastapi.svg)Deploy FastAPI to Vercel](https://vercel.com/templates/python/fastapi-python-boilerplate)

[Deploy](/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fvercel%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fexamples%2Ffastapi&template=fastapi)[Live Example](https://vercel-plus-fastapi.vercel.app/)

### [Get started with Vercel CLI](#get-started-with-vercel-cli)

Get started by initializing a new FastAPI project using [Vercel CLI init command](/docs/cli/init):

terminal

```
vc init fastapi
```

This will clone the [FastAPI example repository](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/fastapi) in a directory called `fastapi`.

## [Exporting the FastAPI application](#exporting-the-fastapi-application)

To run a FastAPI application on Vercel, define an `app` instance that initializes `FastAPI` at any of the following entrypoints:

*   `app.py`
*   `index.py`
*   `server.py`
*   `src/app.py`
*   `src/index.py`
*   `src/server.py`
*   `app/app.py`
*   `app/index.py`
*   `app/server.py`

For example:

src/index.py

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
 
app = FastAPI()
 
@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Python": "on Vercel"}
```

You can also define an application script in `pyproject.toml` to point to your FastAPI app in a different module:

pyproject.toml

```
[project.scripts]
app = "backend.server:app"
```

This script tells Vercel to look for a `FastAPI` instance named `app` in `./backend/server.py`.

### [Build command](#build-command)

The `build` property in `[tool.vercel.scripts]` defines the Build Command for FastAPI deployments. It runs after dependencies are installed and before your application is deployed.

pyproject.toml

```
[tool.vercel.scripts]
build = "python build.py"
```

For example:

build.py

```
def main():
    print("Running build command...")
    with open("build.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write("BUILD_COMMAND")
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

If you define a [Build Command](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration#buildcommand) in `vercel.json` or in the Project Settings dashboard, it takes precedence over a build script in `pyproject.toml`.

### [Local development](#local-development)

Use `vercel dev` to run your application locally.

terminal

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
vercel dev
```

Minimum CLI version required: 48.1.8

### [Deploying the application](#deploying-the-application)

To deploy, [connect your Git repository](/new) or [use Vercel CLI](/docs/cli/deploy):

terminal

```
vc deploy
```

Minimum CLI version required: 48.1.8

## [Serving static assets](#serving-static-assets)

To serve static assets, place them in the `public/**` directory. They will be served as a part of our [CDN](/docs/cdn) using default [headers](/docs/headers) unless otherwise specified in `vercel.json`.

app.py

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse
 
app = FastAPI()
 
@app.get("/favicon.ico", include_in_schema=False)
async def favicon():
    # /vercel.svg is automatically served when included in the public/** directory.
    return RedirectResponse("/vercel.svg", status_code=307)
```

`app.mount("/public", ...)` is not needed and should not be used.

## [Startup and shutdown](#startup-and-shutdown)

You can use [FastAPI lifespan events](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/events/) to manage startup and shutdown logic, such as initializing and closing database connections.

main.py

```
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI
 
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Startup logic
    print("Starting up...")
    await startup_tasks()
    yield
    # Shutdown logic
    await cleanup_tasks()
 
app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
```

Cleanup logic during shutdown is limited to a maximum of 500ms after receiving the [SIGTERM signal](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/functions-api-reference#sigterm-signal). Logs printed during the shutdown step will not appear in the Vercel dashboard.

## [Vercel Functions](#vercel-functions)

When you deploy a FastAPI app to Vercel, the application becomes a single [Vercel Function](/docs/functions) and uses [Fluid compute](/docs/fluid-compute) by default. This means your FastAPI app will automatically scale up and down based on traffic.

## [Limitations](#limitations)

All [Vercel Functions limitations](/docs/functions/limitations) apply to FastAPI applications, including:

*   Application size: The FastAPI application becomes a single bundle, which must fit within the 250MB limit of Vercel Functions. Our bundling process removes `__pycache__` and `.pyc` files from the deployment's bundle to reduce size, but does not perform application bundling.
